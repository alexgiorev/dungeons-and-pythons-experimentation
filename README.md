# How to start the game

The general way to start is `py main.py <dungeon-file>+`

For example: `py main.py dungeons/dun1 dungeons/dun2 dungeons/dun3` or equivalently `py main.py dungeons/dun[1-3]` starts the game with three dungeons.

# Console commands

You can start the console by pressing backquote (the key below ESC), at which point a prompt `>>>` will appear. Just type some characters and press ENTER.

The 'q' command is used to exit the game. The 'r' command is used to restart the current dungeon.

# Controls

You can move around using the numpad keys: `8` for up, `2` for down, `4` for left, `6` for right.

To use your fists to do damage, press `f` followed by the desired direction. For example, pressing `f` followed by `2` uses the hero's fists to hit downwards. Similarly, `4` hits to the left. Attacking with spells and weapons is similar, except that the keys 's' and 'w' are used, respectively. So to cast a spell upwards, type `s` followed by `8`. To use the weapon downwards, type `w` followed by `2`.
